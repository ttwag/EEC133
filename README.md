# EEC133 - Electromagnetic Radiation & Antenna Analysis

![Figure1](./image/figure1.jpeg)

This repository contains notes and homework answers for EEC133 from the University of California, Davis in Fall 2024. This course studies how antenna physically transforms circuit parameters like voltage and current into free space electromagnetic waves. We also examined the characteristics of dipole, loop, and phase array antennas.
